If this is your first time visiting, then this website is perfect for you! The complex weather patterns of our planet can sometimes be strange and confusing, so we have provided a comprehensive guide to our seasons. (As they relate specifically to the north-western part of the United States)

			<p>
			If you follow any of the links in the navigation panel, they will take you on a brief tour of the four seasons: Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter.
